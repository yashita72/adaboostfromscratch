# AdaBoost From Scratch 🚀

This project is a complete implementation of the **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)** algorithm built from scratch to understand the core concepts of ensemble learning without relying on pre-built machine learning libraries.

## 📌 Project Overview

AdaBoost is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. The goal of this project was to deeply understand how boosting works internally, including weight updates, error calculation, and model importance.

## ⚙️ Features

* Implementation of AdaBoost algorithm step-by-step
* Weak learner training and iterative boosting
* Sample weight initialization and updates
* Alpha (model weight) calculation
* Prediction using weighted majority voting

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Ensemble Learning
* Boosting Techniques
* Weak vs Strong Learners
* Weighted Error Calculation
* Model Evaluation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy (for numerical operations)



## 📊 Learning Outcome

Building AdaBoost from scratch helped in understanding how ensemble models improve performance by focusing on misclassified samples and combining multiple weak models into a stronger predictor.
